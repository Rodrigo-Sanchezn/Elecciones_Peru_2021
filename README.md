# Extracting the presidential results: PERÚ - 2021

## Description
This project uses a Python web scrapping library, Selenium, to access the webpage that shows the presidential elections results in Perú (2021).
Although it works well, the code needs a few adjustments for it to deliver the outcome in the expected format.

## Motivation
This came up as an idea to make it easy for me to track how the results were developing as the votes were being added to the count.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was made by Rodrigo Sánchez, student at Universidad del Pacífico (Lima, Perú), in 2021.
